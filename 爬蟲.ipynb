      "---------------------------UPDATE 11/4/2017---------------------------After all the negative reviews and feedback on the poor sound quality of the 2nd generation Echo it appears that Amazon has taken quick steps to help remedy the issue.  I spoke with an Amazon representative on the phone who confirmed that there has been a software update which is rolling out to Echo devices.  After getting the update my Echo does indeed sound better!  I still wouldn't call it audiophile-quality by any means, but the bass is fuller and the sound is less \"tinny\" overall.To check which software version you have, select \"Settings\" on your Alexa phone app, choose your Echo device, then scroll down the page to where it says \"Device software version.\"  The updated version (as of 11/4/17) is 592452420 (previously it was 592452320).You don't have to do anything to get the update; it will be sent automatically by Amazon.  You may see the indicator light on your Echo will pulse blue as the update is installed.  The representative I spoke with said you may get it more quickly by not using your Echo for several hours.  I hit the mute button on mine and received the update within a few hours.  I'm very impressed by Amazon's quick response to this issue!-----------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------------------------As a very happy owner of three Echo Dots (2nd generation) I was glad to see Amazon release a 2nd generation of the Echo as well.  After using it for several days I can say I'm quite pleased with it, and even though it doesn't have any radical new features compared with the 1st Generation Echo or the Echo Dot, there are some notable improvements.  I'll summarize these differences first and then describe the new Echo in a bit more detail.Improvements over the Echo 1st Generation:- More color and texture choices- A swappable outer shell- Ability to output audio to another device or stereo system via Bluetooth or an auxiliary cable- Dolby-powered speakers- Significantly lower price!Differences from the Echo Dot (2nd gen):- Larger size and swappable outer shell (these are probably obvious)- 2 speakers (tweeter and woofer) vs. 1- Power adapter sits flatter against the wall---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the \"Heather Gray Fabric\" version.  The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades of gray which certainly gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray.  The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives it a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams \"I'm a device!\"In terms of size, the Echo 2nd Generation is almost the same diameter (3.5\") as the 1st Generation Echo (3.3\"), but it is several inches shorter.  To me the original Echo looked like a tower; this shorter version is much less ostentatious.The top of the device is identical to the 2nd Gen Echo Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button), a multi-colored light ring around the edge that tells you about the Echo's status, and seven tiny holes below which the microphones sit.A new feature of this Echo is its swappable decorative shell.  Simply press a button on the underside of the device and the shell slides right off, allowing you to replace it with any of the other shells that Amazon sells.  I'm not sure how many people will take advantage of this feature given that additional shells are $20-30, but it could be useful if you want to change your Echo's look to match a different location in your home.A final note on appearance: the power adapter for the Echo sits fairly flat against the wall, protruding maybe 1.5\".  By contrast, the Dot's adapter sticks out from the wall 2-3 inches.  The flatter adapter of the Echo is nice if you want to plug it into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.--------------------Audio quality--------------------I did a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd Generation Echos, and despite the new Dolby-powered speakers I did not notice a significant difference in sound quality with either music or spoken text.  I certainly wouldn't call it \"room filling sound\" in any case.  Clarity isn't bad, but bass is nearly non-existent.  However, the real potential improvement in sound quality comes not from the speakers themselves but from a new feature for 2nd Generation Echo devices: using Bluetooth or a 3.5mm auxiliary cable (not included), you can play the audio through a nearby speaker or stereo system.  Yes, this does means you are using two devices to accomplish one thing, but in a sense it's no different than plugging any other sound source into your stereo system.  To be honest, I don't generally think of the Echo primarily as a music playback device anyway other than for very casual listening (but I realize that puts me in a minority... admittedly I'm a bit of an audiophile).Compared with the Echo Dot, however, there IS a noticeable difference in sound.  This shouldn't be a surprise given that the Echo has two speakers (a tweeter and a woofer) while the Dot has only one.  To my ear the difference isn't so much in clarity but rather in fullness.  With two speakers and a bit more acoustic \"heft,\" the Echo's sound has more presence than the Dot's, which to me makes it more tolerable to listen to for a period of time.  The difference is even more appreciable with music than with newscasts or other spoken text.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------This is one area where I must confess I'm disappointed.  Like the 2nd Generation of the Dot, the Echo 2nd Generation uses seven microphones beneath its top surface to recognize voice commands spoken from any direction.  My wife and I both found this Echo to be slightly LESS proficient at detecting our voices and recognizing vocal commands than our Dots are.  We did side-by-side comparisons of the Echo and the Dot in several locations around our house and the Dot was nearly always better at picking up our voices (and yes, we only had one plugged in at a time!).  I'm not sure why this would be since both devices use similar technology, but the difference was pretty consistent.  One possible explanation I can think of is this: Both devices have their microphone openings on their top surfaces, effectively pointing upward.  Because the Echo is taller than the Dot, if you put both devices side by side and speak to them from several feet away, your voice will hit the Dot's microphones at a slightly more downward (i.e., direct) angle than the Echo's, which may help the Dot pick up your voice better.  Obviously I'm only speculating here, but in support of this theory I have noticed that both devices have difficulty detecting my voice if I speak from below them (for example, if I'm sitting on the floor and the device is on a table).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that overall functionality -- what the Echo 2nd generation \"does\" -- is nearly identical to the 1st generation Echo and the Dot.  Keep in mind that the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds features to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.Personally I have two favorite Alexa skills: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature.  The flash briefing is fully customizable daily \"digest\" of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"What's my flash briefing?\"  There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining.  Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it.  For example, I configured mine with NPR news, BBC news, the weather, and a word of the day.  I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom.  Simply ask Alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected.  My wife and I use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house.  You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature.  Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number.  Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate.  By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established.  For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] -----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately the Echo 2nd Gen shares an annoying trait of the Echo Dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing.  As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as One America News) come through quietly while others (like Fox News) are much louder.  I don't know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case I hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd Generation Echo than it is with the Dot.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment.Another complaint I have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the Flash Briefing.  One America News is an example here: you can listen to the channel's live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel's \"top stories summary\" as part of your Flash Briefing.  This issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me.--------------A few tips--------------1) The Echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits).  Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent).  If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms).  One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\"  The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!4) Some speakers have a bit of a \"burn-in\" period, so in an attempt to improve my Echo's sound I left it playing music for much of the first few days I had it.  The sound did seem to improve a LITTLE, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it's still not stellar.  But if you're not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit.--------------------------Which one to buy?--------------------------If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device.  The single biggest practical difference between the two is that the Echo has fuller, better quality sound.  So if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the Echo's better acoustics.  On the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the Dot is more than sufficient.  I have a Dot in our home theater room that I use exclusively to control the lights in that room.  For that type of single-purpose application anything more than a Dot would be overkill.==========Bottom line==========Although the Echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner.  If you already own a 1st generation Echo there probably isn't a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality isn't significant.  But if this is your first Echo device you will probably be very pleased with it.  And if you are deciding between the Echo and the Dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device.  For heavy listening, the Echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the Dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the Echo!\n",
      "Update: Amazon has pushed a software update and sound quality now sounds great.I was originally disappointed in the 2nd Gen as my original review (below) shows.  Shortly after posting the review Amazon reached out to me for additional information.  They contacted me again today and said they took my, and others, feedback regarding the sound quality seriously.  The Amazon rep informed me my Echo was selected to be part of a test group asked me if I would want to install a new software update to address the problem.  She walked me through the steps to ensure the update was applied and asked me to test the audio (she stayed on the phone while I did this).With my 2nd Gen and original 1st Gen Echo in a multi-room group (that's a really nice feature) I had Alexa fire up my playlist.  I was surprised to find the 2nd Gen now sounded much improved.  As I walked between rooms with the two Echo's I was also surprised that the 2nd Gen sounded better than my 1st Gen, the bass and mid-range had a better quality.  Not believing my own ears I had my wife also give it a listen and she agreed.The Amazon rep said they were working with a small group of customers like me to verify the update and they would be pushing the update to all customers very soon (update to my update, looks like Amazon is now pushing out the software broadly!).  You can check your software version by using the Alexa app and looking at your Echo device settings. FYI, after the update my Gen2 shows Device Software Version 592452420 (the original was 592452320).Other than audio, the Gen 2 is nearly identical to the original Gen 1 with exception of form factor.  The Gen 2 is shorter (5.9\") and wider (3.5\").  For comparison Gen 1 was 9.2\" x 3.3\".  The Gen 2 has many 'skin' options, I chose the fabric option. Comparatively the Gen 1 had a look of plastic and metal.  The Gen 2 cover is removable so you can replace with other skins.As for responsiveness, Gen 2 specs show better microphone array.  From my use I've not noticed anything improved. That said I was very happy with the Gen 1 responsiveness to commands, the Gen 2 continues to be as responsive.All other functions seem to be the same as Gen 1 including blue ring that indicates \"listening\", buttons on top to activate for \"Alexa\" and button to mute the microphone array. There is also a 3.5mm jack port and bluetooth to connect to other speakers. There is a design change, with Gen 1 you would turn the ring to change volume, that's been replaced with +/- buttons (following same design change as the Dot releases).---[Original Review - 1 Star]---I bought my first Amazon Echo back in 2014.  Since then I've added a second Echo (1st gen), a tap and 3 dots.  I've added Vaux Cordless Home Speaker VAUX Cordless Home Speaker + Portable Battery for Amazon Echo Dot Gen 2 Gray/Ash to two of my Dots.  I've given Echo as gifts.  In other words I'm all in on Amazon Echo system and have been for a long time.Amazon advertises this as 2nd Generation as \"improved sound\".  I thought the original Echo (1 gen) sounded great so I fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker.  Unfortunately after listening to it I find it's a sinker indeed, or perhaps a stinker.I did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen Echo.  I had them both play a set of songs.  I'm just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is DISAPPOINTING when it comes to sound quality.  While it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds tinnier than the 1st gen.  Whatever \"powered by Dolby\" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.The unit otherwise functions like the original and other than the form factor I see nothing that's an improvement.  I haven't seen that it \"hears\" better.  And it doesn't sound better for sure.Perhaps I'm too focused on the sound of Echo 2nd gen, but when Amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being \"improved sound\", I'd expect the sound to be noticeably improved. It doesn't and therefore give it a 1 star rating.\n",
      "I got some smart plugs so that I could turn on inside lights if we come home after dark with the app on my phone.My 82 y.o. Dad lives with me & has a hard time walking & he's also losing his ability to see at all in the dark, because of Macular Degeneration. So the last thing I need is him tripping over something in the dark, trying to turn lights on!!I have an Echo & Dot in my room, which I mostly use to stream music with my Amazon Music Unlimited.I was controlling even his bedroom light & the hallway light with the app on my phone as well as my Echo.So I bought two more Dots during prime day sale.It's been a game changer!!  My Dad struggled, even with the app on his phone to control the lights. Now that we have a Dot in his bedroom & an Echo & Dot in the living room, he's very easily learned how to ask Alexa to turn on the hallway light, his bedroom light when he's going to bed!! NO MORE STUMBLING AROUND IN THE DARK or trying to remember where he put his flashlight!!Since the Echo Dots all sync together, once he gets to his bedroom, he tells Alexa to turn off the living room light & the hallway light when he gets to his bedroom!!  This little device is a SAVING GRACE, not only for my Dad, but for me!! I don't have him calling me to \"Show me again how to turn the lights on/off\" with his phone app!!It's like having someone else here that helps me take care of my Dad!!I made a list of the commands for the lights, etc & hung one on his night stand & put the other beside his chair in the living room!!He's also exploring, BY HIMSELF, different commands for Alexa. I've heard him ask her about the weather, baseball scores, etc. THIS LITTLE ITEM IS A TRUE GEM FOR SENIORS!! I love mine just as much & the quality of the sound thru the Echo is AMAZING for listening to music.  I'm VERY PICKY about sound quality!! I have Bose speakers hooked up to my TV & have Bose ear buds as well.  The quality of the sound from the Echo is just as good as Bose speakers!!\n",
      "I'm a long time owner of both the Echo Gen 1 & the Echo Dot Gen 2, and have been very happy with both. I pre-ordered the Echo Gen 2 and was excited to receive it. When I hooked it up and played some music thru it, and then told Alexa to stop, the music continued to play for a short burst. I do not have that problem with my Gen 1. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. When I hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. On Nov 3rd I contacted the Amazon Echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the Gen 2, and it would be fixed by Nov 6th. Well, today is Nov 8th and nothing's changed, so regrettably I am returning my second Gen 2. I might add, after reading other reviews, I agree that the quality of the sound from the Gen 2 is, at best, worse than my Gen 1. Voices are muffled and music is not crisp. Amazon's claim of improved sound was my major reason for purchasing this 2nd generation device. It was indeed a disappointment.\n",
      "I purchased a 3 pack of the new Echo to get the $50.00 discount special. I had read other reviews where folks weren't happy with the sound quality of the speaker during music playback. I must admit that after I set up the first unit and played some music I would tend to agree. Flat base and a bit washed out over all. But Wait!!  There's good news. As I set up the second and third Echos the first unit that had been set up for 10 minutes or so said, \"I'm updating, I'll be available shortly\". One by one each speaker received an update from Amazon and I have no idea how but after updating they sound \"AMAZING\" Full, rich base, excellent vocals and overall sounds as good as my JBL or UE Boom. If you are thinking of getting these but were afraid after reading the not so great sound quality reviews, go ahead. You will be more than pleased after receiving the updated software. AAAAA+++++ and the \"Play Everywhere\" effect sounds amazing.\n",
      "I was very exited about trying out the new echo 2nd generation.  After all, I was cautious and did not buy the 1st generation but after seeing all the reviews about the it is decided it's time to get mine. I waited to buy the 2nd Gen as like anyone else the ad said it will be improved quality on the 1st generation.I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the music play.  It did not sound as good as they tried to sell it. Poor quality from the music though Alexa's voice is sharp and crisp. The voice control is very responsive even from my other room which is impressive.  All the functions performed exceptional for me except the music playback which was the most important feature I wanted. I planned on buying the 3 pack for the entire home, but that is on hold unless there's significant audio improvement.\n",
      "I was a bit cautious about buying this- but it went on sale and I figured, even if I hate it I can return it...  Well, I LOVE IT!  I am not a super-tech-savvy guy, but I had it set up and playing music within 20 minutes of it being delivered to my home.  I used my iPad to \"install\" it (after getting the free Alexa app), and that was it.  No problems.  Sound is fantastic, and even though I bought it mainly for the music, I can see me using it to ask about the weather, how far it is to the nearest Domino's pizza, and how late does my local grocery stay open.  If you like to listen to music and ask general questions, this is fantastic.  If you are really interested, you can do all kinds of other stuff with it.  I think I will keep it simple.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Not responsive. I am returning it. Amaozn is sending another one. I hope the new one is better. I also have a Dot, it response every time. I sure hope the new one works as well as the dot does. The top lights up like it hears me but nothing happen. If I give it the same command over and over again eventually it will work.  Not what I was hoping for.\n",
      "Let me count the ways...She turns on and off our Christmas lights, sets our alarms, reminders, schedules, to-dos, plays our favorite music and even reads to us.The only way she could get any better is if she had her own plugs and switches. Its coming, Alexa. Its coming!😉Seriously though, if you have thought about creating a smart home I encourage you to buy one and give it a go. We started with one. We ordered the echo dot, plugged it in for about 10 minutes, fell in love with it, and ordered one echo tower for dining room, master bedroom and my son's room. All the other rooms in the house have dots. My office has dots. My car has a dot. It just really allows us to use technology to our advantage!\n",
      "Really good device with a large, ever growing ecosystem of capabilities and connection options. Really love how useful it can be, however, there are a few things of note:- Google Assistant is much better at understanding my voice, and interpreting what I mean. Your mileage may vary of course (different accents), but Alexa gets 3/5 for understanding me, and Google Assistant gets 4/5 (Srini is 1/5 and Cortana 2/5).- This specific device has had some challenges keeping a connection to my WiFi (very rarely though), while my Echo Gen, and Google Home Mini does not. Maybe a slight defect, or further firmware updates needed in future (currently at lastest version) but still...The audio is much better than the Echo Gen. 1 which is really nice when listening to music, even though it is not a high end stereo system. Overall I really like it and recommend.\n"

For example, I configured mine with NPR news, BBC news, the weather, and a word of the day.  I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom.  Simply ask Alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected.  My wife and I use this feature all the time when we need to communicate from opposite ends of the house.  You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature.  Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number.  Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate.  By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established.  For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!] -----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately the Echo 2nd Gen shares an annoying trait of the Echo Dot: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing.  As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as One America News) come through quietly while others (like Fox News) are much louder.  I don't know whether this variability is due to differences in how each component of the feed is produced or whether it has to do with the device itself, but in any case I hoped the phenomenon would be less pronounced with the 2nd Generation Echo than it is with the Dot.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Just be prepared to adjust the volume at the beginning of each segment.Another complaint I have is the inability to listen to certain feeds outside of the Flash Briefing.  One America News is an example here: you can listen to the channel's live feed any time, but you can only hear the channel's \"top stories summary\" as part of your Flash Briefing.  This issue is probably more software than device related, but still, it bugs me.--------------A few tips--------------1) The Echo seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits).  Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent).  If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms).  One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\"  The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!4) Some speakers have a bit of a \"burn-in\" period, so in an attempt to improve my Echo's sound I left it playing music for much of the first few days I had it.  The sound did seem to improve a LITTLE, (the lower frequencies filled in some), but it's still not stellar.  But if you're not happy with the sound at first, let it play frequently for a few days and it may improve a bit.--------------------------Which one to buy?--------------------------If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Dot, think carefully about how you plan to use the device.  The single biggest practical difference between the two is that the Echo has fuller, better quality sound.  So if you plan to use the device mostly for listening to music, news, podcasts, or whatever, you will probably appreciate the Echo's better acoustics.  On the other hand, if you want to use it mainly for voice control of smart home devices, the Dot is more than sufficient.  I have a Dot in our home theater room that I use exclusively to control the lights in that room.  For that type of single-purpose application anything more than a Dot would be overkill.==========Bottom line==========Although the Echo 2nd generation may not have any earth-shattering new features compared with the 1st generation, its significantly lower price and ability to send music to another speaker or stereo system make it a winner.  If you already own a 1st generation Echo there probably isn't a compelling reason to upgrade because the difference in sound quality isn't significant.  But if this is your first Echo device you will probably be very pleased with it.  And if you are deciding between the Echo and the Dot, which one you purchase comes down to how you want to use the device.  For heavy listening, the Echo may be preferable for its better acoustics; otherwise, the Dot is a great deal -- especially at half the price of the Echo!\n",
      "Update: Amazon has pushed a software update and sound quality now sounds great.I was originally disappointed in the 2nd Gen as my original review (below) shows.  Shortly after posting the review Amazon reached out to me for additional information.  They contacted me again today and said they took my, and others, feedback regarding the sound quality seriously.  The Amazon rep informed me my Echo was selected to be part of a test group asked me if I would want to install a new software update to address the problem.  She walked me through the steps to ensure the update was applied and asked me to test the audio (she stayed on the phone while I did this).With my 2nd Gen and original 1st Gen Echo in a multi-room group (that's a really nice feature) I had Alexa fire up my playlist.  I was surprised to find the 2nd Gen now sounded much improved.  As I walked between rooms with the two Echo's I was also surprised that the 2nd Gen sounded better than my 1st Gen, the bass and mid-range had a better quality.  Not believing my own ears I had my wife also give it a listen and she agreed.The Amazon rep said they were working with a small group of customers like me to verify the update and they would be pushing the update to all customers very soon (update to my update, looks like Amazon is now pushing out the software broadly!).  You can check your software version by using the Alexa app and looking at your Echo device settings. FYI, after the update my Gen2 shows Device Software Version 592452420 (the original was 592452320).Other than audio, the Gen 2 is nearly identical to the original Gen 1 with exception of form factor.  The Gen 2 is shorter (5.9\") and wider (3.5\").  For comparison Gen 1 was 9.2\" x 3.3\".  The Gen 2 has many 'skin' options, I chose the fabric option. Comparatively the Gen 1 had a look of plastic and metal.  The Gen 2 cover is removable so you can replace with other skins.As for responsiveness, Gen 2 specs show better microphone array.  From my use I've not noticed anything improved. That said I was very happy with the Gen 1 responsiveness to commands, the Gen 2 continues to be as responsive.All other functions seem to be the same as Gen 1 including blue ring that indicates \"listening\", buttons on top to activate for \"Alexa\" and button to mute the microphone array. There is also a 3.5mm jack port and bluetooth to connect to other speakers. There is a design change, with Gen 1 you would turn the ring to change volume, that's been replaced with +/- buttons (following same design change as the Dot releases).---[Original Review - 1 Star]---I bought my first Amazon Echo back in 2014.  Since then I've added a second Echo (1st gen), a tap and 3 dots.  I've added Vaux Cordless Home Speaker VAUX Cordless Home Speaker + Portable Battery for Amazon Echo Dot Gen 2 Gray/Ash to two of my Dots.  I've given Echo as gifts.  In other words I'm all in on Amazon Echo system and have been for a long time.Amazon advertises this as 2nd Generation as \"improved sound\".  I thought the original Echo (1 gen) sounded great so I fell for the 2nd gen hook, line and sinker.  Unfortunately after listening to it I find it's a sinker indeed, or perhaps a stinker.I did an informal test with my 1st gen and new 2nd gen Echo.  I had them both play a set of songs.  I'm just going by what my set of ears tells me, but the 2nd gen is DISAPPOINTING when it comes to sound quality.  While it does seem to have a deeper bass, the overall quality sounds tinnier than the 1st gen.  Whatever \"powered by Dolby\" is supposed to bring to the 2nd get unit is not much, this 2nd gen is just not up to par with the original when it comes to audio.The unit otherwise functions like the original and other than the form factor I see nothing that's an improvement.  I haven't seen that it \"hears\" better.  And it doesn't sound better for sure.Perhaps I'm too focused on the sound of Echo 2nd gen, but when Amazon makes it a point to expressly market it as being \"improved sound\", I'd expect the sound to be noticeably improved. It doesn't and therefore give it a 1 star rating.\n",
      "I got some smart plugs so that I could turn on inside lights if we come home after dark with the app on my phone.My 82 y.o. Dad lives with me & has a hard time walking & he's also losing his ability to see at all in the dark, because of Macular Degeneration. So the last thing I need is him tripping over something in the dark, trying to turn lights on!!I have an Echo & Dot in my room, which I mostly use to stream music with my Amazon Music Unlimited.I was controlling even his bedroom light & the hallway light with the app on my phone as well as my Echo.So I bought two more Dots during prime day sale.It's been a game changer!!  My Dad struggled, even with the app on his phone to control the lights. Now that we have a Dot in his bedroom & an Echo & Dot in the living room, he's very easily learned how to ask Alexa to turn on the hallway light, his bedroom light when he's going to bed!! NO MORE STUMBLING AROUND IN THE DARK or trying to remember where he put his flashlight!!Since the Echo Dots all sync together, once he gets to his bedroom, he tells Alexa to turn off the living room light & the hallway light when he gets to his bedroom!!  This little device is a SAVING GRACE, not only for my Dad, but for me!! I don't have him calling me to \"Show me again how to turn the lights on/off\" with his phone app!!It's like having someone else here that helps me take care of my Dad!!I made a list of the commands for the lights, etc & hung one on his night stand & put the other beside his chair in the living room!!He's also exploring, BY HIMSELF, different commands for Alexa. I've heard him ask her about the weather, baseball scores, etc. THIS LITTLE ITEM IS A TRUE GEM FOR SENIORS!! I love mine just as much & the quality of the sound thru the Echo is AMAZING for listening to music.  I'm VERY PICKY about sound quality!! I have Bose speakers hooked up to my TV & have Bose ear buds as well.  The quality of the sound from the Echo is just as good as Bose speakers!!\n",
      "I'm a long time owner of both the Echo Gen 1 & the Echo Dot Gen 2, and have been very happy with both. I pre-ordered the Echo Gen 2 and was excited to receive it. When I hooked it up and played some music thru it, and then told Alexa to stop, the music continued to play for a short burst. I do not have that problem with my Gen 1. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one without a hassle. When I hooked the replacement up, the same issue was there. On Nov 3rd I contacted the Amazon Echo department, and they advised me that there was a known issue with the music on the Gen 2, and it would be fixed by Nov 6th. Well, today is Nov 8th and nothing's changed, so regrettably I am returning my second Gen 2. I might add, after reading other reviews, I agree that the quality of the sound from the Gen 2 is, at best, worse than my Gen 1. Voices are muffled and music is not crisp. Amazon's claim of improved sound was my major reason for purchasing this 2nd generation device. It was indeed a disappointment.\n",
      "I purchased a 3 pack of the new Echo to get the $50.00 discount special. I had read other reviews where folks weren't happy with the sound quality of the speaker during music playback. I must admit that after I set up the first unit and played some music I would tend to agree. Flat base and a bit washed out over all. But Wait!!  There's good news. As I set up the second and third Echos the first unit that had been set up for 10 minutes or so said, \"I'm updating, I'll be available shortly\". One by one each speaker received an update from Amazon and I have no idea how but after updating they sound \"AMAZING\" Full, rich base, excellent vocals and overall sounds as good as my JBL or UE Boom. If you are thinking of getting these but were afraid after reading the not so great sound quality reviews, go ahead. You will be more than pleased after receiving the updated software. AAAAA+++++ and the \"Play Everywhere\" effect sounds amazing.\n",
      "I was very exited about trying out the new echo 2nd generation.  After all, I was cautious and did not buy the 1st generation but after seeing all the reviews about the it is decided it's time to get mine. I waited to buy the 2nd Gen as like anyone else the ad said it will be improved quality on the 1st generation.I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the music play.  It did not sound as good as they tried to sell it. Poor quality from the music though Alexa's voice is sharp and crisp. The voice control is very responsive even from my other room which is impressive.  All the functions performed exceptional for me except the music playback which was the most important feature I wanted. I planned on buying the 3 pack for the entire home, but that is on hold unless there's significant audio improvement.\n",
      "I was a bit cautious about buying this- but it went on sale and I figured, even if I hate it I can return it...  Well, I LOVE IT!  I am not a super-tech-savvy guy, but I had it set up and playing music within 20 minutes of it being delivered to my home.  I used my iPad to \"install\" it (after getting the free Alexa app), and that was it.  No problems.  Sound is fantastic, and even though I bought it mainly for the music, I can see me using it to ask about the weather, how far it is to the nearest Domino's pizza, and how late does my local grocery stay open.  If you like to listen to music and ask general questions, this is fantastic.  If you are really interested, you can do all kinds of other stuff with it.  I think I will keep it simple.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Not responsive. I am returning it. Amaozn is sending another one. I hope the new one is better. I also have a Dot, it response every time. I sure hope the new one works as well as the dot does. The top lights up like it hears me but nothing happen. If I give it the same command over and over again eventually it will work.  Not what I was hoping for.\n",
      "Let me count the ways...She turns on and off our Christmas lights, sets our alarms, reminders, schedules, to-dos, plays our favorite music and even reads to us.The only way she could get any better is if she had her own plugs and switches. Its coming, Alexa. Its coming!😉Seriously though, if you have thought about creating a smart home I encourage you to buy one and give it a go. We started with one. We ordered the echo dot, plugged it in for about 10 minutes, fell in love with it, and ordered one echo tower for dining room, master bedroom and my son's room. All the other rooms in the house have dots. My office has dots. My car has a dot. It just really allows us to use technology to our advantage!\n",
      "Really good device with a large, ever growing ecosystem of capabilities and connection options. Really love how useful it can be, however, there are a few things of note:- Google Assistant is much better at understanding my voice, and interpreting what I mean. Your mileage may vary of course (different accents), but Alexa gets 3/5 for understanding me, and Google Assistant gets 4/5 (Srini is 1/5 and Cortana 2/5).- This specific device has had some challenges keeping a connection to my WiFi (very rarely though), while my Echo Gen, and Google Home Mini does not. Maybe a slight defect, or further firmware updates needed in future (currently at lastest version) but still...The audio is much better than the Echo Gen. 1 which is really nice when listening to music, even though it is not a high end stereo system. Overall I really like it and recommend.\n"

    "content = 'This is a 20 pack of food grade storage boxes by Enther in  9” x 6” x 2” which holds 28 ounces.  (I took some close up photos so you can see the details.  Let me know if you find this helpful.)Since my family is constantly on the go, we pack a lot of meals so we can eat healthy and be economical.  We pack 3 meals everyday for school and also when we are attending sporting events and activities.  We have a lot of Glad and Ziplock storage containers of different sizes which takes up a lot of room.  I was interested in a set that could be nested tightly for storage so it doesn’t take up as much room.  Also, I usually end up disposing of plastic containers after a while so I wanted something that was economical enough to throw out when they get old.  They are BPA free and recyclable.These are great for meals that don’t have a lot of thin liquid.  I tested it with water and held it on it’s side.  After a minute of shaking I had a drop of water drip out.  If it’s something thick like spaghetti sauce, I wouldn’t have any hesitation to store it in these containers.  The lid stays on when it’s stored sideways in a backpack.  The plastic is not brittle.  It’s rugged without any problems with getting crushed in the kids backpacks.  It’s tricky getting the lid off since the lids don’t have a lip to assist you in pulling it off.  To put the lid on, you have to run your fingers all around the edges to snap it into place.  I wouldn’t recommend this for young children.  They will have a problem trying to open the lid and trying to reseal the lid which could be a huge problem if they haven’t eaten everything.  But then again, a 28 ounce size is quite large for a young child.  They tolerate the top rack of a dishwasher.  The container and lid are stamped “Microwave Safe”.They stack well in a cooler and fit into a variety of lunch box styles and sizes.  It’s a generous sized container and can be used for storage of leftover meals.  LIQUID TESTED / RECOMMENDED FOR OLDER CHILDREN AND ADULTS' "
